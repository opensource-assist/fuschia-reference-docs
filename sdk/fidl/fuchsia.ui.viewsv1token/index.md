## **PROTOCOLS**

## ViewOwner {:#ViewOwner}
*Defined in [fuchsia.ui.viewsv1token/view_token.fidl](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/sdk/fidl/fuchsia.ui.viewsv1token/view_token.fidl#11)*

 A view owner allows linking its associated view into a view hierarchy.

 This interface is only intended to be used as a token, analogous to how
 Scenic View/ViewHolder resources use eventpairs as tokens.
